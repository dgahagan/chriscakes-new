# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

I would like to update the website for a local restaurant. Currently when there are changes I update the HTML manually. I would like to build a new site with the ability for the owners to update content themselves. They would like to update, menu items, menu categories, prices, menu images, and any text on the site. They do not need to be able to change the site design.


## Proposed plan
Frontend: Next.js or plain React or Vanilla Javascript
CMS: Sanity.io
Hosting: Vercel or Netlify (both have generous free tiers) or Github Pages
Build: ????


## Current Website
Current site is located in the ChrisCakes folder. It contains the entire site and .net framework code base from github for the current site.
