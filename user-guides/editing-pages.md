## Editing a Page

### Step 1: Open the Page
1. Click **"Pages"** in the left menu
2. Click on the page you want to edit

### Step 2: Understanding the Editor

Pages use a "rich text" editor that works similarly to Microsoft Word or Google Docs. You can:

- Create bulleted or numbered lists
- Add images
- Create links

### Basic Text Editing

**To add or edit text:**

3. Press Enter to create new paragraphs

**To format text:**
- **Bold**: Select text, click the **B** button (or Ctrl+B / Cmd+B)
- *Italic*: Select text, click the *I* button (or Ctrl+I / Cmd+I)
- Headings: Use the dropdown to select "Heading 2", "Heading 3", etc.

### Adding Headings

Headings help organize your content into sections:

1. Put your cursor where you want a heading
2. Use the style dropdown to select a heading level:
   - **Heading 2**: Main section headings
   - **Heading 3**: Subsection headings
   - **Normal**: Regular paragraph text

**Example structure:**
```
Welcome to ChrisCakes (Heading 2)
We've been creating beautiful custom cakes since 2005... (Normal text)

**Image Tips:**

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I preview my changes before publishing?**
A: The Studio may have a preview option. Look for a "Preview" button. Otherwise, you can save as a draft, publish, wait 60 seconds, check the live site, then edit again if needed.

**Q: I want to add a video. How do I do that?**
A: You typically can't upload videos directly. Instead:
1. Upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo
2. Get the share/embed link
3. Add that link to your page text, or contact your developer about embedding it

**Q: How do I change the order of sections on a page?**
A: You'll need to cut and paste text to reorganize. Select the section you want to move, cut it (Ctrl+X / Cmd+X), click where you want it to go, and paste (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V).

**Q: Can I use colors or different fonts?**
A: This depends on your website's setup. Most content editors use your site's predefined styles to keep everything consistent. If you need special formatting, contact your web developer.

**Q: My page looks different than I expected.**
A: The editor shows basic formatting. The actual website applies additional styling (colors, fonts, spacing) automatically. Your content will look more polished on the live site!

**Q: How often should I update my pages?**
A:
- Update immediately if information changes (prices, services, contact info)
- Refresh content every 6-12 months to keep it current
- Add seasonal updates if relevant to your business

**Q: What if I accidentally delete important content?**
A: The Studio keeps a history of changes. Contact your web developer—they can likely recover it. This is another good reason to be careful with the delete function!

## Writing Tips

### Keep It Clear and Concise
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Break up long sections with headings
- Use bullet points for lists
- Avoid jargon or overly technical language

### Focus on Your Customer
- Answer "What's in it for me?" from the customer's perspective
- Use "you" and "your" more than "we" and "our"
- Include specific benefits, not just features

**Feature**: "We use premium ingredients"
**Benefit**: "You'll taste the difference in every bite with our premium ingredients"

### Include Calls-to-Action
Tell people what to do next:
- "Contact us for a free consultation"
- "Call today to schedule your cake tasting"
- "Visit our menu to see all our offerings"

### Proofread Before Publishing
- Check for spelling and grammar errors
- Read it out loud—does it sound natural?
- Have someone else review it if possible
- Make sure all links work
