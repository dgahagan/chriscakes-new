# Updating Site Settings

Site Settings is where you update your business information that appears throughout the website—things like your phone number, hours, address, and social media links.

## Accessing Site Settings

1. Open the Studio: **www.chriscakesofmi.com/studio**
2. Click **"Site Settings"** in the left menu
3. You'll see one document with all your site-wide settings

**Note**: Unlike menu items, there's only ONE site settings document. You edit the existing one rather than creating new ones.

## What Happens When You Update Settings?

These settings appear in multiple places on your website:

- **Address**: Footer, contact page, possibly maps
- **Hours**: Footer, contact page, possibly home page
- **Social Media**: Footer (usually as icons)
- **Logo**: Header on every page

When you publish changes, **all of these locations update automatically**. You don't need to update each page individually!

## Common Questions

**Q: I updated my phone number but it's not changing on the website.**
A: Three things to check:
1. Did you click "Publish"? (not just save)
2. Did you wait 60 seconds after publishing?
3. Did you refresh your browser? (Press F5 or Cmd+R)

**Q: Can I have different hours for different days?**
A: Yes! Just type them in the hours field, one line per day (see examples above).

**Q: What if I don't have a social media account for something?**
A: Just leave it out! Only add the social networks you actually use.

**Q: My logo looks blurry or weird.**
A: Try uploading a larger, higher-resolution version. PNG format usually works best.

**Q: Can I temporarily close without deleting everything?**
A: Yes! Update your hours to say "Temporarily Closed" or "Closed Until [Date]". You can also add a note in your site description.

**Q: What's the difference between save and publish?**
A:
- **Save** = Saves your work as a draft (only you can see it)
- **Publish** = Makes it live on the actual website (everyone can see it)

## Holiday Hours Example

If you want to show special holiday hours:

**Option 1: Update the Hours Field Temporarily**
```
Monday - Friday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM

Sunday: Closed

HOLIDAY HOURS (Dec 24-26):
Dec 24: 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM
Dec 25: CLOSED
Dec 26: 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM
```

**Option 2: Add a Notice to Description**
Update your site description to include: "Please note: We will be closed December 25-26 for the holiday."

**Remember**: Change it back after the holiday!
