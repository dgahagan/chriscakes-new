# Managing Menu Categories

Categories help organize your menu into sections like "Cakes," "Cupcakes," "Breakfast Items," etc. This makes it easier for customers to find what they're looking for.

## Understanding Categories

Think of categories as the main sections of your menu. Each menu item belongs to one category. For example:

- **Cakes** category contains: Wedding Cakes, Birthday Cakes, Custom Cakes
- **Cupcakes** category contains: Red Velvet Cupcakes, Chocolate Cupcakes
- **Breakfast** category contains: Muffins, Scones, Coffee Cake

## Viewing Your Categories

1. Open the Studio: **www.chriscakesofmi.com/studio**
2. Click **"Menu Categories"** in the left menu
3. You'll see all your current categories

## Adding a New Category

### When to Add a Category
- You're adding a new type of product to your offerings
- You want to split a large category into smaller, more specific ones
- You're starting a new service (like catering or breakfast items)

### Steps to Create:

1. Click the **"+ Create"** button

## Tips for Good Categories

### Keep It Simple
- Don't create too many categories (4-8 is usually ideal)
- Customers should immediately understand where to look
- If a category only has 1-2 items, consider combining it with another

### Use Clear Names
- "Wedding Cakes" is better than "Special Occasion Tier Cakes"
- "Cupcakes" is better than "Individual Servings"
- Think about what your customers call these items

### Maintain Balance
- Try to have a similar number of items in each category
- If one category is huge, consider splitting it
- If several categories are tiny, consider combining them

### Update Seasonally
- Create "Holiday Specials" or "Summer Items" categories
- Move items in and out as seasons change
- Keep seasonal categories at the top using the Order field

## Common Questions

**Q: How many categories should I have?**
A: Most bakeries work well with 4-8 categories. Too few and customers can't find things easily. Too many and it gets overwhelming.

**Q: Can one menu item be in multiple categories?**
A: No, each item can only be in one category. If an item fits multiple categories, pick the best fit or create a "Popular Items" category.

**Q: What happens if I delete a category that has items in it?**
A: The system usually won't let you delete it. You need to move all items to other categories first.

**Q: Can I have a category with no items temporarily?**
A: Yes, but customers might wonder why it's empty. Consider removing empty categories or adding a note in the description like "Coming Soon!"

**Q: Should I create a "Specials" or "Featured" category?**
A: This can work well! Use the Featured checkbox on menu items to mark them, and they might appear in special places on your site automatically.

## Category Order Example

Let's say you want your menu to appear in this order:
1. Featured Items
2. Cakes
3. Cupcakes
4. Other Desserts

Set the Order field like this:
- Featured Items: Order = 1
- Cakes: Order = 2
- Cupcakes: Order = 3
- Other Desserts: Order = 4

Or use bigger gaps for flexibility:
- Featured Items: Order = 10
- Cakes: Order = 20
- Cupcakes: Order = 30
- Other Desserts: Order = 40

This way you can easily add new categories in between later!
