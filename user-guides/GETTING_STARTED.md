# Getting Started with ChrisCakes Website Management

Welcome! This guide will help you manage your ChrisCakes website without needing any technical knowledge. You can update menu items, prices, photos, business hours, and much more—all through a simple web interface.

## What You'll Be Using

You'll manage your website through something called the **Sanity Studio**. Think of it as your website's control panel—a user-friendly place where you can make all your changes.

## Accessing the Studio

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
2. Go to your website: **www.chriscakesofmi.com/studio**
3. Log in with your Sanity account credentials

**Important**: You'll need to be given access to the ChrisCakes Sanity project. If you don't have login credentials yet, contact your website administrator.

## How Changes Work

When you make changes in the Studio, here's what happens:

1. **You make a change** (like updating a price or adding a photo)
2. **You click "Publish"** (always remember this step!)
3. **Wait up to 60 seconds** for the live website to update automatically
4. **Refresh your website** to see the changes

**Important**: Changes are NOT live until you click the "Publish" button. You can save drafts and come back to them later.

## The Studio Interface

When you first open the Studio, you'll see a menu on the left side with different sections:

- **Menu Items** ✅ - Add, edit, or remove items from your menu (fully editable)
- **Menu Categories** ✅ - Organize your menu into sections (fully editable)
- **Site Settings** ✅ - Update your phone number, hours, address, etc. (fully editable)
- **Testimonials** ✅ - Manage customer reviews (fully editable)
- **FAQs** ✅ - Update frequently asked questions (fully editable)

**Note**: While you'll see a "Pages" section in the Studio, the main website pages (About, Services, Fundraising, etc.) are currently hard-coded and require developer assistance to update. See the [Editing Pages](./editing-pages.md) guide for details.

## Your First Change

Let's try something simple to get comfortable:

1. Click **"Site Settings"** in the left menu
2. Find the **"Phone"** field
3. Make sure your phone number is correct
4. Click **"Publish"** at the bottom
5. Wait 60 seconds, then visit your website and verify the phone number updated

Congratulations! You just made your first website update.

## Important Tips

### Always Publish
- **Draft** = Not live on the website (only you can see it)
- **Published** = Live for everyone to see
- The publish button is your friend—use it when you're ready!

### Be Patient
- After publishing, wait **60 seconds** before checking the live site
- Refresh your browser page (F5 or Cmd+R) to see changes

### Use Good Photos
- Upload clear, well-lit photos of your cakes and food
- Avoid blurry or dark images
- Recommended size: At least 1000 pixels wide

### Save Your Work
- You can save drafts without publishing
- If you need to step away, just save—your changes will be there when you return

**Remember**: You can't break anything! If you make a mistake, you can always go back and fix it. The Studio keeps a history of changes, so nothing is ever truly lost.
