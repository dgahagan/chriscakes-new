# Contact Form Guide

Your website has a contact form that lets customers reach out to you with questions or orders. This guide explains how the contact form works and how to handle the emails you receive.

## How the Contact Form Works

### What Customers See

When someone fills out your contact form, they provide:
- **Name**: Their full name
- **Email**: Their email address
- **Phone**: Their phone number (optional)
- **Message**: Their question or request

After they click "Send," they see a confirmation that their message was sent.

### What You Receive

You'll get an email notification with:
- The customer's name
- Their message
- Their email address
- Their phone number (if they provided one)

**Important Feature**: The email is set up with a "Reply-To" header, which means you can simply click "Reply" in your email program to respond directly to the customer. You don't need to copy and paste their email address!

## Responding to Contact Form Submissions

### Quick Response

1. **Check your email** regularly (at least once or twice per day)
2. **Click "Reply"** in your email program
3. **Type your response** to the customer
4. **Click "Send"**

That's it! The reply will go directly to the customer's email address.

### Response Time Tips

**Fast responses = happy customers!**
- Try to respond within **24 hours** (sooner is better)
- Even if you don't have a full answer yet, acknowledge receipt:
  - "Thanks for your message! I'll get back to you with details by tomorrow."
- Set up email notifications on your phone so you don't miss inquiries

## Common Contact Form Messages

### Quote Requests

**Customer writes:**
"Hi, I'd like to get a quote for a birthday cake for my daughter's 5th birthday party. We need it for June 15th. It will serve about 30 people. Can you help?"

**Your response might include:**
- Thank them for contacting you
- Ask any additional questions (flavor preferences, design ideas, dietary restrictions)
- Provide pricing information or next steps
- Suggest a phone call or in-person consultation if needed
- Confirm availability for their date

**Example response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out! I'd love to help with your daughter's birthday cake.

For a cake serving 30 people, I have several size options available. To provide you with an accurate quote, I'd like to know:

1. Do you have any flavor preferences? (Chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, etc.)
2. Do you have a theme or design in mind for the cake?
3. Any dietary restrictions I should know about?

June 15th is available! My prices for cakes serving 30 typically range from $XX to $XX depending on design complexity.

Would you like to schedule a time to discuss the details? You can call me at [phone number] or reply to this email with your answers and I'll send you a formal quote.

Looking forward to creating something special for your daughter!

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Handling Different Types of Inquiries

### Wedding Cake Inquiries
- These are high-value and deserve extra attention
- Suggest a phone call or in-person consultation
- Ask for their wedding date first (check availability)
- Request guest count, colors, venue
- Send a formal follow-up email summarizing what you discussed

### Corporate Orders
- Ask about budget and timeline upfront
- Confirm quantities needed
- Discuss delivery/setup options
- Get billing information (do they need an invoice?)
- Be professional and detail-oriented

### Dietary Restrictions
- Ask specific questions (vegan, gluten-free, nut allergy, etc.)
- Be honest about what you can and can't accommodate
- Explain any cross-contamination risks if relevant
- Provide clear pricing for specialty items

### Complaints or Issues
- Respond quickly and professionally
- Acknowledge their concern
- Apologize if appropriate
- Offer a solution
- Take the conversation offline (phone call) for sensitive issues

**Example:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm very sorry to hear you weren't satisfied with [specific issue]. This is not the experience we want our customers to have.

I'd like to make this right. Can we schedule a time to talk by phone today or tomorrow? You can reach me at [phone number].

I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
```

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on the quote I sent for your [event type] on [date].

Do you have any questions I can answer? I'm happy to discuss options or make any adjustments.

If you've decided to go in a different direction, no problem at all—I appreciate you considering ChrisCakes!

Best regards,

## Common Questions

**Q: What email address do the form submissions come to?**
A: They go to the email address listed in your Site Settings. Make sure to check that email regularly!

**Q: Can I change what email address receives the forms?**
A: Yes! Update the email address in Site Settings, and all future form submissions will go to the new address.

**Q: What if I accidentally delete a customer's email?**
A: Check your email trash/deleted items folder. If it's not there, you may need to contact the customer directly if you have their information from another source.

**Q: Do customers get a copy of their message?**
A: This depends on your form setup. Some contact forms send an automatic confirmation to the customer. Even if they don't, they should see an on-screen confirmation after submitting.

**Q: Can I save response templates?**
A: Yes! Most email programs let you create templates or "canned responses" for common inquiries. This can save you time while still being personal.

**Q: What if I get spam through the contact form?**
A: Occasionally spam happens. Just delete it and move on. If it becomes excessive, contact your web developer about adding additional spam protection.

**Q: Should I respond to every single message?**
A: Yes! Even if it's just to say "Thanks, but we don't offer that service." Every inquiry deserves a response—it's good for your reputation.
