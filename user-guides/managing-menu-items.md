# Managing Menu Items

This guide shows you how to add, edit, and remove items from your menu. Menu items are the individual cakes, cupcakes, and other products you sell.

## Viewing Your Menu Items

2. Click **"Menu Items"** in the left menu
3. You'll see a list of all your current menu items

## Adding a New Menu Item

### Step 1: Create the Item
1. Click the **"+ Create"** button (usually in the top area)
2. Select **"Menu Item"** from the options
3. You'll see a blank form to fill out

### Step 2: Fill in the Details

**Name** (Required)
- Enter the name of your item exactly as you want it to appear
- Example: "Chris Cakes Deluxe" or "Box Lunches"

**Slug** (Required)
- This creates the web address for the item
- Click **"Generate"** next to the slug field
- It will automatically create one from your item name
- Example: "chris-cakes-deluxe"

**Description**
- Describe your item in a sentence or two
- Mention key details like ingredients, what's included, or serving size
- Example: "Unlimited pancakes served with two eggs, sausage links, and hash browns. A hearty breakfast for any event!"

**Price**
- Enter the price as a number (don't include the $ sign)
- Example: Enter "24.99" for $24.99
- **Special**: Enter "0" if you want to show "Call for pricing!" instead of a price

**Category** (Required)
- Click the **"Select"** button
- Choose the category this item belongs to (Breakfast Menus, Lunch & Dinner, A-La-Carte, etc.)
- Don't see the right category? See [Managing Categories](./managing-categories.md)

**Image**
- Click **"Upload"** to add a photo of your item
- Choose a clear, well-lit photo from your computer
- The photo should be at least 1000 pixels wide for best quality
- After uploading, you can add "Alt Text" (a description for accessibility)

**Available**
- Check this box if the item is currently available for order
- Uncheck it if the item is temporarily out of stock
- Unavailable items won't show on your menu

**Featured**
- Check this box if you want to highlight this item
- Featured items may appear specially on your site (like on the home page)

**Allergens**
- List any common allergens: eggs, dairy, nuts, gluten, etc.
- Separate multiple allergens with commas
- Example: "Eggs, Dairy, Gluten"

**Order**
- This number controls where the item appears in lists
- Lower numbers appear first
- Example: Order "1" appears before Order "2"
- If you don't set this, items will be sorted alphabetically

### Step 3: Publish
1. Review all your information
2. Click the **"Publish"** button at the bottom
3. Wait 60 seconds for the website to update

## Marking an Item as Out of Stock

Don't delete items that are temporarily unavailable—just mark them!

3. **Uncheck** the box
4. Click **"Publish"**

The item will be hidden from your menu but you can easily bring it back by checking the box again.

## Deleting a Menu Item

**Warning**: This permanently removes the item. Only do this if you're absolutely sure!

1. Open the menu item you want to delete
2. Click the **three dots** menu (⋯) in the top right
3. Select **"Delete"**
4. Confirm the deletion
5. The item is removed immediately

**Better option**: Instead of deleting, consider unchecking "Available" to hide it temporarily.

## Tips for Great Menu Items

### Photos
- Use natural lighting when photographing food
- Show the actual meal or setup (not stock photos)
- Make sure the photo is in focus
- Show what guests will actually receive at their event

### Descriptions
- Be specific about flavors and ingredients
- Mention serving sizes or portions
- Keep it short but informative
- Use appetizing words!

### Pricing
- Be consistent (all breakfast menus use similar pricing structure)
- Use "0" for items that require custom quotes based on group size
- Update prices regularly to stay current

### Organization
- Use the Order field to put your best sellers first
- Group similar items together with categories
- Mark seasonal items as unavailable when out of season

## Common Questions

**Q: Why isn't my new item showing on the website?**
A: Check these things:
- Did you click "Publish"? (not just save)
- Did you wait 60 seconds and refresh the page?
- Is the "Available" box checked?
- Did you select a category?

**Q: Can I duplicate an item instead of creating from scratch?**
A: Yes! Open an existing item, click the three dots menu (⋯), and select "Duplicate". Then edit the copy.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: Just edit the item again and republish. Changes can always be fixed!

**Q: How do I reorder items on the menu?**
A: Use the "Order" field. Items with lower numbers appear first. You can use 1, 2, 3... or 10, 20, 30... if you want room to add items in between later.
