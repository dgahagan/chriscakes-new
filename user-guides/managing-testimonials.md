## Best Practices

### Getting Permission
- **Always** ask permission before posting a customer's review
- Get their approval on the exact wording
- Ask if they're comfortable with their full name or prefer initials

### Choosing Good Testimonials
- Look for specific praise (not just "Great!")
- Include details about the product or service
- Show different types of events (weddings, birthdays, corporate)
- Mix different kinds of feedback (taste, appearance, service)

### What Makes a Strong Testimonial?

**Weak Example:**
"Good cake!"
- Too short
- Not specific
- Doesn't tell a story

**Strong Example:**
"We ordered a three-tier wedding cake with custom sugar flowers, and it exceeded all our expectations. Not only was it stunning—matching our colors perfectly—but every single guest commented on how delicious it was. ChrisCakes made the ordering process easy and stress-free!"
- Specific details
- Mentions both appearance and taste
- Describes the experience

### Photo Tips
- Use photos of your actual work (the cake you made)
- Or photos of happy customers with their cakes
- Make sure you have permission to use any photos
- Clear, well-lit photos work best

## Organizing Testimonials

### Using the Featured Flag
Feature your 3-5 best testimonials:
- Most detailed and enthusiastic reviews
- Reviews that mention specific services
- Recent reviews (shows you're currently active)
- Reviews from different types of events

### Using the Order Field
Arrange testimonials strategically:
1. **Order 1**: Your absolute best review
2. **Order 2-4**: Other strong, featured reviews
3. **Order 5+**: Good but less prominent reviews

Or organize by date:
- Newest reviews first (shows recent activity)
- Give recent reviews lower order numbers

### Balancing Your Testimonials
Try to include:
- Different types of events (weddings, birthdays, etc.)
- Different products (cakes, cupcakes, etc.)
- A mix of long and short testimonials
- Both new and long-time customers

## Common Questions

**Q: How many testimonials should I have?**
A: Quality over quantity! 5-10 strong testimonials are better than 50 weak ones. Feature your best 3-5.

**Q: Can I edit what a customer wrote?**
A: Only with their permission. You can fix obvious typos or shorten it slightly, but always get their approval first. Better to ask them to provide a revised version.

**Q: Should I include negative reviews?**
A: Generally no. This is your website to showcase your business. However, you should address negative feedback privately with the customer.

**Q: What if I don't have customer photos?**
A: That's fine! Photos are optional. The quote itself is most important. You can use photos of your cakes instead of customer photos.

**Q: How do I ask customers for testimonials?**
A: After a successful order:
- Send a follow-up email asking for feedback
- Keep it simple: "Would you mind sharing a few sentences about your experience?"
- Make it easy: Provide a simple form or just ask them to reply to the email
- Thank them for their time

**Q: Should I include the customer's full name?**
A: Ask the customer their preference. Some people are fine with full names, others prefer "Sarah J." or just "Sarah."

**Q: Can I move testimonials from other sites (like Facebook)?**
A: Yes, but always ask permission first. Copy the review exactly as written and credit the customer properly.

## Example Workflow: Adding a New Review

1. **Customer sends you positive feedback via email**
   - "Hi! Just wanted to say the birthday cake was perfect. My daughter loved the unicorn design and everyone said it was delicious. Thank you!"

2. **Ask for permission**
   - Reply: "Thank you so much! Would it be okay if we shared your kind words on our website? We can use your first name or full name—whatever you're comfortable with."

3. **Customer approves**
   - They say: "Sure! You can use my full name, Sarah Johnson."

4. **Add to Studio**
   - Go to Testimonials → Create new
   - Quote: "The birthday cake was perfect. My daughter loved the unicorn design and everyone said it was delicious. Thank you!"
   - Author: Sarah Johnson
   - Author Title: Birthday Cake Customer
   - (Optional) Upload photo of the unicorn cake
   - Publish!

5. **Thank the customer**
   - Let them know it's live and thank them again
